        <p><b>A hacker</b> is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a
            goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has
            become associated in popular culture with a security hacker - someone who utilizes their technical know-how
            of
            bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to
            them -
            hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement
            agencies
            sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This
            could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing
            as
            criminals themselves.[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal
            conduct
            of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement
            and
            security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of both
            legal
            and illegal warfare.</p>

        <h2>Definitions
            <hr>
        </h2>
        <h3><b>General definition</b></h3>
        <p>
            Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word "hacker":
            <br>1.Originally, hacker simply meant advanced computer technology enthusiast (both hardware and software)
            and
            adherent of programming subculture; see hacker culture.<sup>[3]</sup>
            <br>2.Someone who is able to subvert <mark>computer security.</mark> If doing so for malicious purposes, the
            person can also be called a <mark>cracker.</mark><sup>[4]</sup>
            <br><br>
            Today, mainstream usage of "hacker" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the
            word
            since the 1990s.<sup>[5]</sup> This includes what hacker slang calls "script kiddies", people breaking into
            computers using programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage
            has
            become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist.[6] While the
            self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security
            hackers,
            people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and
            emphasize
            the difference between the two by calling security breakers "crackers" (analogous to a safecracker).
        </p>

        <h3><b>Representation in mainstream media</b></h3>
        <p>The <mark>mainstream media's</mark> current usage of the term may be traced back to the early 1980s. When the
            term, previously used only among computer enthusiasts, was introduced to wider society by the mainstream
            media
            in 1983,<sup>[8]</sup> even those in the computer community referred to computer intrusion as "hacking",
            although not as the exclusive definition of the word. In reaction to the increasing media use of the term
            exclusively with the criminal connotation, the computer community began to differentiate their terminology.
            Alternative terms such as <mark>"cracker"</mark> were coined in an effort to maintain the distinction
            between
            "hackers" within the legitimate programmer community and those performing computer break-ins. Further terms
            such
            as <mark>"black hat" </mark> <mark>"white hat"</mark></mark> and <mark>"gray hat"</mark> developed when laws
            against breaking into computers came into effect, to distinguish criminal activities from those activities
            which
            were legal.</p>
        <h2>Types
            <hr>
        </h2>
        <h3>Security related hacking</h3>
        <p> Main article: Security hacker</p>
        <p>Security hackers are people involved with circumvention of computer security. Among security hackers, there
            are
            several types, including:</p>

        <h3><b>White hat hacker</b></h3>
        <p>White hats are hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that
            can
            be mitigated. White hats are usually employed by the target system's owner and are typically paid (sometimes
            quite well) for their work. Their work is not illegal because it is done with the system owner's consent.
        </p>

        <h3>Black hat hacker</h3>
        <p>Black hats or crackers are hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and
            are
            usually motivated by personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is like a black hat
            hacker,<sup>[18]</sup> but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to make profits
            or
            to benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and often use them to
            their
            advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the exploit to other black hat hackers,
            who
            in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties.</p>

        <h3>Grey hat hacker </h3>
        <p>A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical
            standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Motives
            <hr>
        </h2>
        <p>Four primary motives have been proposed as possibilities for why hackers attempt to break into computers and
            networks. First, there is a criminal financial gain to be had when hacking systems with the specific purpose
            of
            stealing credit card numbers or manipulating banking systems. Second, many hackers thrive off of increasing
            their reputation within the hacker subculture and will leave their handles on websites they defaced or leave
            some other evidence as proof that they were involved in a specific hack. Third, corporate espionage allows
            companies to acquire information on products or services that can be stolen or used as leverage within the
            marketplace. Lastly, state-sponsored attacks provide nation states with both wartime and intelligence
            collection
            options conducted on, in, or through cyberspace.<sup>[19]</sup></p>
